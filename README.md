## CS231n Solutions

These are my problem set solutions for the [Spring 2018 version of Stanford's CS231n course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2018/). Please note that this iteration of the course used TensorFlow 1, and so these solutions have only been tested for TensorFlow 1.6 and later. The Spring 2019 version of the course uses Tensorflow 2.0


My final project for the class is under review; a preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02942) and the code is available [here](https://github.com/williamgilpin/convoca)
